In progress Minecraft Clone in C++ using Modern OpenGL... more info later.

Guess I should update this a bit now. Manually there's two branches right now.
- Main
- MacOS

- The Main 'should' work on Linux and Windows anndndd Mac now (??) and is up to date on rendering.
- The MacOS is older on rendering but got to work locally on mac. Haven't checked main branch
- I will check later if the Main branch works on my mac. Hopefully it does, if you see this and try on mac and doesn't work... sorry, ig I haven't fixed it yet (hehehehe)
